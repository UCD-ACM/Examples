    "In a previous notebook we implemented a simple feedforward neural network and used it to classify handwritten digits. In this notebook we modify the simple network, adding several improvements which improve the accuracy of the network. As before, the code in this notebook is an adaption of the code (network2.py) included with the book \"[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)\" by Michael Nielsen, specifically the [version and adapted to work with Python 3](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython) by Michal Daniel Dobrzanski."
